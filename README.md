# scriptlanguages-services

A Jahia DX module providing services allowing for rich interaction with DX core from scripting languages. It should
be possible to re-implement essential DX taglibs using solely these services so that we can have feature parity between
'native' (i.e. `JSP`) and other scripting languages.

## Features
- Implements necessary services to provide support for external scripting languages to expose

## Requirements
- Jahia 7.2.0.0 or more recent
- Maven 3.0+ for module compilation
- JDK 7+
